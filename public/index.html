                                skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology üíª. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of
                                Science with Honours in Computer Science, my academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience
                                gained through internships at esteemed organizations such as the Government of Canada üá®üá¶ and Telesat üåü,
                                where I served as a Software Developer and Software Engineer respectively. Beyond my academic and
                                professional endeavors, I am actively engaged in extracurricular activities, contributing as a Software
                                Engineer at uOttawa Bionics ü§ñ and serving as an external director for Prep for Tech üß†. My passion for
                                technology, combined with practical experience and involvement in diverse projects, drives my ambition to make
                                meaningful contributions to the industry and society at large üåç.

This, combined with constant feedback during the development process, ensured that he implemented his ideas in a way so that all their needs were met. From a technical standpoint, the software was coded in two languages. Java was used to create the GUI, and Python was used to create the backend for some analysis features. Development took place over approximately six months (in two parts). </p>
