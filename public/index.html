                        <p class = "about-me-paragraph"> As a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa üéì, I am committed to honing my
                            skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology üíª. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of
                            Science with Honours in Computer Science, my academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience
                            gained through internships at esteemed organizations such as the Government of Canada üá®üá¶ and Telesat üåü,
                            where I served as a Software Developer and Software Engineer respectively. Beyond my academic and
                            professional endeavors, I am actively engaged in extracurricular activities, contributing as a Software
                            Engineer at uOttawa Bionics ü§ñ and serving as an external director for Prep for Tech üß†. My passion for
                            technology, combined with practical experience and involvement in diverse projects, drives my ambition to make
                            meaningful contributions to the industry and society at large üåç.

                                <li> Engineered the Biomass Cover Crop project by leveraging GEE‚Äôs Python API, with Google Colab, and ArcGIS. </li>
                                <li> Reduced GEE image band statistical analysis and generation time by 96% from 45 minutes to 2 minutes while also resolving
                                    computation timeout and user memory limit exceeded errors. </li>
                                <li> Developed the parameter stacks for cover crop mapping which allows users to stack bands (multiple layers of data) and conduct
                                    an analysis view of multiple biophysical variables (fractional vegetation cover ‚Äì fCOVER, leaf area index ‚Äì LAI, canopy water
                                    content ‚Äì CWC, chlorophyll levels, surface reflectance, albedo, DASF, CCC, fAPAR) as opposed to time series stacks (1 layer). </li>
                                <li> Reduced GEE image collection merge process by 7x by removing duplicate dates and duplicate legacy bands, while also saving
                                    unnecessary memory usage. </li>
                                <li> Utilized and tested the open-source Landscape Evolution And Forecasting (LEAF) Toolbox project, which integrates neural
                                    networks, in conjunction with the Surface Reflectance to Land Products (SL2P) script, tailored to the data from Sentinel-2 and
                                    Landsat-8 satellites. </li>
                                <li> Reduced GEE image date mosaicking process by 86% from 14 minutes to 2 minutes. </li>
                                <li> Developed the process for exporting GEE map products in a GeoTIFF format for further analysis in ArcGIS. </li>
