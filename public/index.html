                        <p class = "about-me-paragraph"> As a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa 🎓, I am committed to honing my
                            skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology 💻. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of
                            Science with Honours in Computer Science, my academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience
                            gained through internships at esteemed organizations such as the Government of Canada 🇨🇦 and Telesat 🌟,
                            where I served as a Software Developer and Software Engineer respectively. Beyond my academic and
                            professional endeavors, I am actively engaged in extracurricular activities, contributing as a Software
                            Engineer at uOttawa Bionics 🤖 and serving as an external director for Prep for Tech 🧠. My passion for
                            technology, combined with practical experience and involvement in diverse projects, drives my ambition to make
                            meaningful contributions to the industry and society at large 🌍.
